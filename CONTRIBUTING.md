# Contributing

Welcome to your first step to contribute to the development and maintenance of RMUIF! This template’s main goal is to provide a starting-point for apps that is secure, fast, and pleasing to the eye. It is important that every change take into account these rudimentary points.

## Creating an issue

There are some rules you need to follow to speed up the process of reporting and triaging issues.

### Reporting a bug

If you’ve found a bug with the project itself, use the [Report a bug](https://github.com/rmuif/web/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) template when creating an issue on GitHub. Following the template will help contributors to more easily identify the bug and fix it. Bug reports that don’t follow the template might be dismissed, edited, and deprioritized.

### Suggesting a feature

Is something missing from the project that you want to see in the next version? Create an issue using the [Request a feature](https://github.com/rmuif/web/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) template and we’ll consider it. Again, following the template is paramount to getting your issue prioritized.
