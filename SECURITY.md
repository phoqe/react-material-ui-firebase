# Security Policy

The security of RMUIF is incredibly important, not only for the project itself but its users too. The code in this project is meant to be used in production and in the hands of a lot of users. We try to accomodate developers by applying the best security practices to the best of our abilities. Shortcomings in security leaves the app vulnerable to attackers and we want to ensure that this risk is minimized.

## Supported versions

Version 2 of RMUIF featured an update system using the official RMUIF repository as an ”upstream repository“. You could fetch and pull down the latest changes, should any conflicts arise, you could resolve them manually as a merge conflict.

The current version of RMUIF does not support updates, at the moment. However, we are developing a method that you’ll be able to use in the future.

The versions we are working towards now are within the 3.x range. Unfortunately, we no longer maintain the same structure as 2.x, hence 2.x is no longer _officially_ supported.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 3.x     | :white_check_mark: |
| 2.x     | :x:                |

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you’ve found a vulnerability within the project, contact [rmuif@phoqe.dev](mailto:rmuif@phoqe.dev) for further instructions. Depending on the severity, it might be best to keep it behind closed doors for the moment.
